# Idle Recycle - ENSE 405

## Background
In a world increasingly aware of environmental concerns, recycling stands out as a key initiative for sustainability. "Idle Recycle" is a game that aims to blend the simple, engaging mechanics of idle games with educational insights into recycling. Our goal is to create an interactive gaming environment that not only entertains but also informs players about the recycling process in a manner that is both enjoyable and engaging.

## Business Need
Idle games captivate players with their uncomplicated yet addictive gameplay. Seeing the potential to combine this genre with the educational elements of recycling, "Idle Recycle" addresses the rising demand for games that entertain while educating. Our project taps into this desire for interactive learning, providing players with insights into how recycling impacts our environment.
